How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
a good way to start is to figure out what you want the end product to be. 
one way to start is to look beforehand at what criteria needs to be met and what it needs to not be able to do. 
testing small segments can help to successfully test fragments of code. te test successfully edge test and negative test should be run, to increase the testing coverage. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
the best way to interpret user needs is to look deeper than the initial request. such as if the user says they want a button. consider what the button does and it's purpose.
It also helps to consider each need a requirement. such as if it says must nit be null, you know that null should be an invalid input. 
How do I approach designing software?
To approach designing software, it's best to start with the basics. Like what are the boundaries and requirements. 
to design the data flow and patterns needed to follow. 
As well as a simple draft of the design to make sure it meets requirement in a practical way. 
inputs should be validated and testing covering a substantial amount of the code. 
Each part should be documented for transparency and record keeping.
